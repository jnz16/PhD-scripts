# PhD-scripts

This is a repository containing all the scripts that I have created to analyse various sets of data throughout my PhD. Hope this is useful for some of you! And that it helps you run some code for your own data. Please e-mail me if you need any help/clarification and even more if you find any mistakes! 

You will find scripts for the analysis of AGO-PAR-CLIP, RNA-seq analysis and just basic differential expression of human gene expression datasets publically avaialble (ie. TCGA, METABRIC and specific publications)!
